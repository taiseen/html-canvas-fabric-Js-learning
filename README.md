Fabric.js
Fabric.js is a JavaScript library that let you control the HTML5 canvas element as an object. By using this library, we can add object into canvas.

1st we need a canvas & initialize it with Fabric.js.
Create an object by JavaScript & add into the canvas.

# Properties :
Each object has its own properties, such as top, left, width and height. 
You can override the default value.

# Methods :
Each object has its own useful methods.
We'll need them if we want to manipulate the canvas via JavaScript
